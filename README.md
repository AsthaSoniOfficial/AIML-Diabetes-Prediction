# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning  

A machine learning project that predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on health parameters such as glucose level, BMI, age, pregnancies, etc.  
This project is part of my **BITS Pilani WILP - AIML journey**, and showcases my practical application of ML concepts in real-world healthcare data.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
Diabetes is a chronic condition that can be managed effectively if detected early.  
Using the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset**, this project builds and evaluates machine learning models to predict diabetes risk.  

The project demonstrates:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Model building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Model evaluation with metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)  
- Interactive prediction app using **Streamlit**  

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for EDA and experimentation  
- **Streamlit** for interactive web app  
- **GitHub** for version control & portfolio showcase  

---

## ðŸ“Š Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing/invalid values  
   - Feature scaling and encoding  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Correlation heatmaps  
   - Distribution plots  

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest  
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
   - Model comparison on accuracy & recall  

4. **Deployment**
   - Built a simple web app using Streamlit  
   - User inputs health data â†’ Model predicts **Diabetic / Non-Diabetic**  

---

## ðŸ”® Results
- Achieved **~80% accuracy** with Random Forest  
- Balanced recall and precision to reduce false negatives (important in healthcare)  
- Streamlit app allows non-technical users to test predictions easily
